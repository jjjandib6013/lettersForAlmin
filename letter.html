                            <p>Merry Christmas, Almin!</p>
                            <p>I hope you’re doing well and having a wonderful Christmas!</p>
                            <p>I’ve created something for you, and I hope you’ll like it.</p>
                            <p>As you’ve already seen the last one I sent you, this one is also special—</p>
                            <p>Your existence means more than words can fully express.</p>
                            <p>Not just for who you are,</p>
                            <p>but for what your existence has meant to me.</p>
                            <p>Your existence matters so much to me, more than I can put into words.</p>
                            <p>It’s not just that you’re here in this world, but the way your presence has unknowingly left a significant impact on my life.</p>
                            <p>It all started last month, mid-November during one of the DARKEST periods I’ve ever faced—</p>
                            <p>a time when I was completely on the edge, overwhelmed by everything life had thrown at me.</p>
                            <p>Life was truly relentless then. :((</p>
                            <p>Finals sa school were unbearably stressfuLLLLLLL LIKE AS IN</p>
                            <p>With each subject piling on so much work that it felt impossible to handle like LITERALLY.</p>
                            <p>At home, things were falling apart, and my family was on the brink of breaking down.</p>
                            <p>There were countless other tasks and responsibilities I couldn’t bring myself to finish because I was constantly drained, distracted, and overwhelmed.</p>
                            <p>It felt like every corner of my life was riddled with problems. :((</p>
                            <p>Problems here, problems there, problems everywhereeeeeeeee.</p>
                            <p>Amidst all those chaos, I hit a point where I genuinely wanted to give all up.</p>
                            <p>I was numb—</p>
                            <p>physically, mentally, and especially emotionally.</p>
                            <p>I couldn’t even feel myself anymore.</p>
                            <p>Everything felt heavy, and even the smallest things became unbearable.</p>
                            <p>So I attempted to escape the pain and avoid overthinking, I started watching an anime.</p>
                            <p>I thought it would help me pass the time and give my mind a break from the ENDLESS spiral of thoughts.</p>
                            <p>And then, out of nowhere, something happened.</p>
                            <p>There was a certain scene in the anime that suddenly brought back something I hadn’t felt in a long time.</p>
                            <p>A memory?</p>
                            <p>A feeling?</p>
                            <p>It was something powerful.</p>
                            <p>It reminded me of the time during junior high school when I first saw you and fell for you at first sight and even more when we talked that time.</p>
                            <p>Idk if you can remember pa ato sauna nga sigi ko sungog ug pabo kay diha ra ko kutob. HAHAHAHA</p>
                            <p>I know this might sound weird, surprising, or even cringe, but it’s the truth.</p>
                            <p>It was real, and honestly, it was the first time jud nga I’d ever felt something like that.</p>
                            <p>I had never experienced that kind of feeling before jud at that moment—</p>
                            <p>where someone just caught your attention so completely bitaw that it felt like everything else around you disappeared for a moment.</p>
                            <p>At that moment, I realized there was something special about you that drew me in, and I couldn’t help but feel a connection, even if I didn’t fully understand it.</p>
                            <p>I didn’t know what to do with those feelings at the time because they were so new and unexpected.</p>
                            <p>And maybe because I was still young, dumb, and broke.</p>
                            <p>So, I ended up keeping it to myself until now.</p>
                            <p>So yea, stop sa there ang backstory. HAHAAHAHAHAH</p>
                            <p>That moment, when those feelings resurfaced during one of my DARKEST periods that I just faced now bitaw, it somehow became a kind of refuge for me.</p>
                            <p>I found solace in them.</p>
                            <p>I took shelter in those memories.</p>
                            <p>Wrapping myself in the warmth of what I had felt back then.</p>
                            <p>In the chaos and pain of everything going on in my life, those feelings were a reminder of something simple and pure.</p>
                            <p>A moment in time when everything seemed brighter. It felt like I could breathe again, even if only for a little while, and I took comfort in it, holding onto that feeling when I needed it the most.</p>
                            <p>Those feelings gave me something to hold on to when everything else seemed hopeless.</p>
                            <p>Those feelings reminded me that life could still hold beauty, even in the midst of pain and despair.</p>
                            <p>Somehow your existence, became a reason for me to fight.</p>
                            <p>To stay.</p>
                            <p>To keep pushing.</p>
                            <p>And to hold on.</p>
                            <p>You unknowingly became a part of the reason I chose to continue despite everything. Hehe</p>
                            <p>So, this gift is not just a token of appreciation—</p>
                            <p>it’s a representation of what your presence meant to me during one of my DARKEST moments in life.</p>
                            <p>It’s my way of saying thank you for being who you are.</p>
                            <p>Solely just for existing.</p>
                            <p>And for giving me something to believe in when I needed it most.</p>
                            <p>Merry Christmas again, Almin.</p>
                            <p>I truly hope this holiday brings you as much joy and comfort as your existence has unknowingly brought to mine. :)</p>
